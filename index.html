
Main changes:
—The update installer is built into the main program
—Unsaved files are marked with a * symbol, and when closing tabs with them, the program offers to save
—Added support for multiple UTF encodings: in the status bar you can select the encoding in which the file will be opened or saved. There is no automatic detection of the encoding of the opened file yet :(

Corrections:

—Minor interface fixes
